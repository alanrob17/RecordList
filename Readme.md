# RecordList

This is my ``RecordList`` application. It contains all the code to display my Website on Azure.

**Note:** at present I have hidden my ``Maintenance`` and ``Statistics`` menu options. I will update the project to add these areas into a secure site.

This is a rewrite of my RecordBD application. I found that Azure had issues with solutions that had more than one project so I combined the application into one project.

[Azure website](https://recordlist20220901113007.azurewebsites.net/).

## To Do

I will need create a list of tasks that need to be completed.

# Future Tasks

Eventually I will need to update this application to add a REST API for data access.
